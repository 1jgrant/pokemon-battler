## About

This project was created to practice implementing the principles of Object Oriented Programming, starting from a two day pair programming sprint. Pokemon, Trainer and Battle classes are used to construct teams based on reference pokemon stats, then take game turns following the original game's logic for turn order and type advantages/weaknesses.

The game uses the promise based Inquirer library to provide user input prompts and handle selections for inputs such as player names and move choices.

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) was used to create thorough test suites for the classes and their methods.

## Technologies

- JavaScript
- [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
- Test-driven development using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test suite

## Setup

to run the game, clone the repo then install it using npm:

```

$ npm run battle
```
